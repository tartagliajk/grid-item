            <p>He first appears in the manga, set some time before the game's story, as a diplomat to Mondstadt. In present day, he makes an appearance during Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo alongside his fellow Harbingers. He makes his in-game debut (in his Omega Build) during Archon Quest Chapter III, Act III, where he is revealed to be working with the sages of Sumeru Akademiya.</p>

                <li>Like the other Harbingers, Dottore's alias is derived from a stock character in commedia dell'arte. "Il Dottore" (The Doctor) is usually extremely rich and bombastic, loving the sound of his own voice. In commedia dell'arte, he typically tries to interfere with the Innamorati (The Lovers). He is also closely linked to Pantalone.</li>
